We were tasked to create as close to a mirror image of the google search homepage as possible.

## How to Run

2. In your terminal be sure you are in this downloaded directory
3. Once you are in the correct directory run this:

  ```
  http-server -p 9999
  ```

4. Then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser to view the knock-off google homepage.
